# AntDTablePagination
This repo contains code base regarding youtube tutorial (https://youtu.be/AXNp_oU1Q80) on how to implement Table pagination with data fetched from server using axios.

Notes: If somehow due to difference in react versions or so, it is not compiled correctly then you can use the code from App.js file into your project directly.
